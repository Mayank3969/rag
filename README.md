rag bot using locall llm and api.
idk who tf is reading this but only version which uses llm locally is usable.
If you want to try open the the local version install requirements and run ollama(obviously install also install llm model) you can change models in codes its quite simple.

->The Local version is my own(copided few lines online) and I use it to summarize my notes and stuff and give most asked questions from my clg pyqs so that I dont have to study unnecessary topics which do not have any relevance whats so ever from this world.
In near future will add web scrapping to it so that it will be great. Youtube made it sound easy idk how it will end but will end.
Also quick WARNING if you use local version. The dolphin mistral is truely uncencored so it will not filter anything, you may even use it to make atomic bomb or cook meth. Use at your own risk.

->As for api version I really dont know what to do really like I got api and all just dont know what to code (skill issue).
But still will try to make it work somehow in near future but for now its the version chat gpt gave me via vibe coding I have trust issue for that.
